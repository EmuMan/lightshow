Effects:
- Effect (struct)
  - Stored in a global SimpleStore
  - Stores universal information about the effect
  - Contains an EffectInfo for more specific informatoin
- EffectInfo (enum/component)
  - Stores initialization information for the effect
- ActiveEffect (entity)
  - Represents the playing instance of an effect
  - Contains a LocalTime that represents the actual current play time
  - Contains a SimpleHandle to an Effect
  - Contains a duplicate version of the EffectInfo that is modified with keyframes

Layers:
- Layer (struct)
  - Stored in a global SimpleStore
  - Contains a LayerInfo
  - Contains a vector of Tracks
- LayerInfo (struct)
  - Represents the parameters associated with a layer on the timeline
- ActiveLayer (entity)
  - Represents the playing instance of a layer
  - Contains a LocalTime that represents the actual current play time
  - Contains a SimpleHandle to a Layer
  - Contains a vector of handles to ActiveTrack entities

Tracks:
- Track (struct)
  - Contains a series of keyframes that refer to both it and the elements inside of it
  - Contains a TrackInfo
  - Contains a TrackContents
- TrackInfo (struct)
  - Contains various information about a track (blending mode, opacity, etc.)
- TrackContents (enum)
  - EffectTrack
    - Contains a SimpleHandle to an EffectInfo
  - LayerTrack
    - Contains multiple Clips
  - TriggerTrack
    - Contains a SimpleHandle to a LayerInfo
    - Plays the associated layer when triggered
- ActiveTrack (entity)
  - Represents the playing instance of a track
  - Contains a LocalTime (directly derived from the parent ActiveLayer LocalTime)
  - Contains a duplicate TrackInfo that is affected by keyframes
  - Contains a TrackReference (SimpleHandle<Layer> plus index)
  - Contains an ActiveTrackContents
- ActiveTrackContents (enum/component)
  - ActiveEffectTrack
    - Contains a handle to an ActiveEffect entity
  - ActiveLayerTrack
    - Contains a handle to an ActiveLayer entity (a track can only play one layer at a time)
  - ActiveTriggerTrack
    - Contains a vector of PastTrigger (struct)s:
      - The GlobalTime the trigger was triggered
      - The GlobalTime the trigger expires (initial time + layer length)
      - A handle to the ActiveLayer entity that was spawned from the trigger

Clips (struct):
- Contains a SimpleHandle to a LayerInfo
- Has a start time, offset, duration, etc.

LayerTree (struct/resource):
- Basically a dictionary
- Keys = index tuple, values = entity IDs


Each tick:
- Layer tree clear
  - Only if a layer was modified (track order, deletion, etc.)
  - Remove all Active______ entities from the world
- Layer tree maintenance
  - Create the primary ActiveLayer if it does not exist
  - Start with the primary ActiveLayer
  - Recursively:
    - For each track in the current layer:
      - Look up that track in the LayerTree
      - If the track is a layer track with no current layer, ignore it
      - If the track does not exist, create it
      - If the track is a layer track and is playing a layer, recurse on that layer
